A [new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02008-y)$^1$ published on July 28th in Nature Neuroscience revealed that our visual system has the capacity to launch a series of protective functions in response to visibly sick people in our immediate vicinity. This is fascinating evidence of a neuro-immune partnership in action and of the remarkable ability of visual cues to produce widespread biological effects within the human body.


### The Story

Trabanelli and colleagues, based at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, leveraged an immersive virtual reality system that simulated the experience of being approached by neutral-, fearful-, or infectious-looking avatars$^1$. Participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible to tactile stimulation on their face (elicited using tiny vibrating discs on the cheeks) applied at multiple distances. Changes in participants’ behaviour, neural activity, and immunological markers were monitored.

Remarkably, visual cues alone were sufficient to trigger protective behavioural responses and to activate a neuroimmunological state of high alert, which occurred at greater distances to infectious avatars than to neutral or fearful ones. Avatars that were perceived to be sick and contagious evoked avoidant behaviour in participants (i.e., increased seating distance) and higher facial sensitivity (i.e., faster reaction times to tactile simulation) at far distances. Visual input is therefore thought to trigger an early alarm system towards a perceived pathogenic threat.

Perhaps their most interesting finding, however, was that of an actual immune response being launched. Blood-based markers pointed to an increased frequency and activation of innate lymphoid cells, usually the immune system’s first-line responders to infection. The researchers noted a response that was equally strong to that produced by real virulent infections in vaccinated participants. This suggests that our visually-triggered alarm system plays a crucial role in priming our immune system to fend off potential invaders.

Electrophysiological recordings also revealed defensive circuitry in action; brain activation within the “saliency network”, traditionally responsible for spotlighting important (i.e., threatening) stimuli in our environment$^2$. In an attempt to explain the downstream immune effects, the researchers also reported a boost in connectivity between the saliency network and the hypothalamus. From there, through its involvement in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the hypothalamus could conceivably modulate levels of circulating stress hormones to signal activation to immune players.

### The Big Picture

An organism’s threat neutralization system is of critical importance, having many different stages and layers of complexity. Under normal conditions (i.e., not under active threat), the human body circulates baseline levels of immune cells and components to detect threats that breach physical barriers (skin, mucous membranes, etc.) and enter the body. These will call for back-up only once the virus has been identified, when the body knows what it’s up against and can produce as many relevant players as possible. This multi-stage organization permits the immune system to remain effective against a diverse landscape of potential invaders, while not exacerbating resources necessary for other biological maintenance functions at rest.

At least, this is the story usually told in undergraduate biology classes. However, this new research points to an extra stage taking place before any physical breach has even occurred. While we might traditionally view the immune system as “blind”—active only once physical threat detection is possible—the findings here suggest that our visual system might be its “canary in a coal mine”. It reveals somewhat of a grey area, where cross-talk between neural and immunological branches of the human body permit a protective response to be mounted in anticipation of a breach rather than in response to one. And survival-wise, this makes sense, like increasing the number of nurses working in acute care once a massive pile-up car crash has been alerted. If the virus does make it into your respiratory system, you now have a stronger team prepared to handle it at the first emergency response stage.

### The Bird’s Eye Review

Our brains are primed to monitor our surroundings and detect threats through a combination of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli in order to react to them as proactively as possible. Loud or unexpected sounds (Is there something in the bushes?), sounds or visual stimuli coming towards us (Should I duck?), quick movements we notice out of the corner of our eye (Is that a predator? Prey?), even the feeling of something landing on your skin (A bug? Something poisonous?): they all trigger a compelling physical and emotional response, priming you to fight or flee.

There is actually a term for this multisensory-motor system defining our brain’s representation of the space surrounding the body: peripersonal space$^{3,4}$. Multisensory neurons across a large network (frontoparietal regions of the brain) maintain vigilance by integrating tactile information with visual and auditory cues and interacting with motor areas to produce appropriate responses$^5$. For example, sensing an object looming towards us and moving our limbs above our head to block it.

Behavioural and neuroimmunological responses to infectious individuals might represent a repurposing of this system towards new threats faced by social species. Animals that live in groups have evolved various pathogen avoidance strategies to limit spreading of disease within members in close contact (i.e., think “social distancing” during the COVID-19 pandemic)$^6$. Such behavioural changes have been reported in a variety of species across the animal kingdom, not just humans and primates$^{7,8}$. The observed signalling between peripersonal space and immune systems via neuro-immune cross-talk is therefore remarkably elegant as a solution to emerging threats in a social setting. Kudos, brain!
